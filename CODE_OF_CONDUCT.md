# Code of Conduct

Welcome, mighty one! You are about to learn the ways of the dinosaur tamers. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with them before trying to tame any dinosaurs yourself.

## Nomenclature

In this document we use the term **dinosaur tamer** to refer anyone who contributes
to LDPL, including (but not limited to) contributors to the repository code,
mantainers, bug reporters, people who code in LDPL, people who submit issues
and anyone interested and/or involved with the language in any way.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
dinosaur tamers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, dislikeness of COBOL or sexual identity, and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintaining dinosaur tamers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintaining dinosaur tamers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the LDPL project or its community. Examples of
representing the project or community include using an official LDPL e-mail
address, posting via an official LDPL social media account, or acting as an appointed LDPL
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the LDPL project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintaining dinosaur tamers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at ***martin (at) ldpl-lang.org***. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Dinosaur Tamers Code in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
