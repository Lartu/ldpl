summary: Compiled programming language for Unix systems, inspired by COBOL 
description: |
        The LDPL project produces the LDPL Programming Language, a free, powerful, compiled, open-source programming language designed from the ground up to be excessively expressive, readable, fast and easy to learn. LDPL was designed to run on Unix systems, including AMD-64 Linux, macOS, ARMv8 Linux, Android Termux and both Intel and PowerPC OS X (tested from Tiger 10.4 onwards). It even supports UTF-8 out of the box.
